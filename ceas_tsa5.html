Although it has become able to move around more actively, it is still unable to battle. It can produce bubbles from its mouth to intimidate opponents.</p>

                <p class="digi-descript"> Tanemon is a Bulb Digimon. It has something that looks like a plant sprout burgeoning from its head. It is a Yuramon that wandered in search of an optimal environment, then settled to the ground and digivolved. Due to its extremely timid personality, if it senses an intruder's presence, it will burrow with the four feet at the base of its body, and completely bury its body portion under the ground.</p>

Because its unexpected movements are also quick, caution is necessary so that it doesn't get away, but it becomes very emotionally attached if shown affection like a pet.</p>

It is always capricious, and that behavior seems to have been attached to Nyaromon as a result of its being like a "cat". Although it is sometimes frivolous due to its overflowing curiosity, it also has a lonely side.</p>

From Punimon, it has accomplished a more animal-like Digivolution, and is covered in tufty body hair. It is still at the peak of playfulness, and it has a prank-loving personality, but its combat instinct has not awakened.</p>
