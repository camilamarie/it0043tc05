                <img src="camila_pic.png" alt="camila marie ceas">
                <p>Hi, I'm Camila Marie Ceas, an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I enjoy creating different stuff and putting it on the internet.
                    Whether people think it is bad or not, it is my way of showing my identity in these works.
                    My goal in life is to be a cybersecurity professional, and keep learning things especially technology-related.
                    I also want to work for companies who promote innovation and change for the better.
                    Another goal I have is to inspire people to not be afraid in showing their love to their work, no matter what people tell them. Like Steve Jobs said, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
                    My role model is Renzon Cruz, who is a seasoned security professional working as a Principal Consultant in Digital Forensics & Incident Response at Unit 42, a division of Palo Alto Networks.
                    All in all, I am dedicated to pursuing my passion for cybersecurity and aim to make a positive impact in the industry through continuous learning and innovation.
                </p>
                <p>I enjoy a lot of hobbies like polaroid photography, coding, learning a new language, crocheting, surfing, watching films, listening to music, playing instruments like piano, ukulele and guitar, I also play games specifically MMORPGs, and I recently started going to the gym.
                    I am very hardworking and passionate about what I do, and anyone who works with me will be guaranteed a quality output from me.
                    Besides from the Steve Job's quote, my favorite quote also came from one of my favorite series of all time, Mr. Robot, which is: "What if changing the world was just about being here, by showing up no matter how many times we get told we don't belong, by staying true even when we're shamed into being false, by being true to ourselves even when we're told we're too different. And if we all held onto that, if we refuse to budge and fall in line, if we stood our ground for long enough, just maybe... The world can't help but change around us."
